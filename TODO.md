# Photo Atlas — Browse & Filter UX backlog

Improvements identified during the UX review. The "Core UX" bundle below is
**done**; the rest is queued for later. Browser-only is the target, so the
responsive/mobile work is intentionally deprioritised.

## Done (core UX bundle)
- [x] **Infinite scroll** — grid pages through the whole library via `offset`
  instead of hard-capping at 120 photos.
- [x] **Lightbox navigation** — `←/→` step between photos, `Esc` closes, plus
  on-screen prev/next arrows (disabled at the ends).
- [x] **Active-filter pills** — applied filters show as removable pills above
  the grid, with a "Clear all".
- [x] **Broader search** — `q` now matches filename, city, country, place
  label, folder/trip and camera make/model (was filename-only).
- [x] Minor: loading row, Enter-to-save on lightbox face inputs.
- [x] **Filter-aware facet counts.** `/api/facets` now accepts the active
  filters and each facet's counts reflect the other filters but not its own
  dimension (Photos-app style); `total` stays the library size. Sidebar passes
  the current filters and refreshes counts as you filter/search.

## Queued

### Filtering correctness & power
- [x] **Multi-select within a facet.** Facet filters (`person_id`, `scene`,
  `country`, `city`, `place`, `year`, `camera`) accept a value or a list:
  OR-within-facet, AND-across-facets. SQL uses `IN (...)` (and OR-of-LIKE for
  camera, an `IN` join for people); the API takes repeated query params; the
  sidebar toggles values and each gets its own removable pill.
  Possible follow-up: an *AND* mode for people ("photos containing A **and** B").
- [x] **Surface `has_faces`.** "👤 Has people" quick-filter chip in the sidebar;
  facets now return a filter-aware `with_faces` count for it.
- [x] **Date range.** Two inclusive `date_taken` inputs (bounded by the
  library's `date_min`/`date_max`); `_where` compares on the date prefix so
  same-day photos with a time component are included. A timeline/scrubber is a
  possible future upgrade.
- [x] **Facet "show more".** Sidebar sections cap at 14 items with a
  "+N more / Show less" toggle (per-facet expand state) instead of silently
  truncating.
- [x] **More sort options.** Sort dropdown now offers newest/oldest, filename
  A–Z / Z–A and "recently indexed"; every key carries an `id` tiebreaker so
  `LIMIT/OFFSET` paging stays stable when the sort value ties.

### Performance & memory at scale
- [x] **Virtualize / window the photo grid.** Implemented option 3 (true
  windowing): the grid is now a positioned canvas whose height spans the whole
  result set, and `renderWindow` keeps only a viewport-sized window (+4 buffer
  rows) of absolutely-positioned, recycled card nodes in the DOM. Node count and
  decoded-bitmap memory stay flat regardless of library size; scroll/resize are
  rAF-throttled, and infinite-scroll loading + lightbox indexing are preserved.
  The layout math (`gridLayout`/`cardOffset`/`windowRange`) is unit-tested via a
  Node harness (`tests/test_web_js.py`). Cards keep `content-visibility: auto`
  as a belt-and-suspenders.
- [x] **Cap the lightbox image size.** The lightbox now loads a bounded
  preview derivative (`preview_size`, default 1600px) from `GET /api/preview/{id}`,
  generated on first request and cached content-addressed under
  `~/.photo_atlas/previews`. The true full-resolution original stays behind a
  "View full size ↗" link to `/api/image/{id}`.
- [x] **Thumbnail `srcset` / sizing.** Thumbnails carry `width`/`height`
  intrinsic hints + `decoding="async"`, and a real `srcset` (`320w` default +
  `640w` retina). The 2x variant is generated and cached on demand via
  `GET /api/thumb/{id}?size=640` (`metadata.cached_resized`, shared with the
  lightbox preview), so hi-DPI screens get crisp thumbs without a re-index.

### Navigation & state
- [x] **URL / history state.** Filters, view and sort are reflected in the
  querystring (`pushState`); the back/forward buttons restore them via
  `popstate`, and a link is shareable/bookmarkable. Covered by a Node-driven
  fake-DOM harness (`tests/test_web_url_state.py`, skips without Node).
- [x] **Infinite scroll near the lightbox end.** Stepping "next" past the last
  loaded photo now pulls the next page (when more remain) and continues; the
  on-screen next arrow stays enabled while more pages exist on the server.

### People / management
- [x] **Rename in the People page.** Each person card has an inline **Rename**
  (Enter saves, Esc cancels) backed by `PATCH /api/persons/{id}`.
- [x] **Merge people** (two clusters of the same person) and **reassign a face**
  to a different/again-unknown person from the lightbox. A card's **Merge**
  control folds it into another person (`POST /api/persons/{id}/merge`); in the
  lightbox, typing a name reassigns a face and a **✕** sends it back to unknown
  (`POST /api/faces/{id}/unassign`).
- [x] **Person cover photo picker.** The **Cover** control lists the person's
  face crops (`GET /api/persons/{id}/faces`) and pins the chosen one
  (`PUT /api/persons/{id}/cover`).

### Robustness & polish
- [x] **Error states.** `api()` is now a thin wrapper that catches network
  failures and non-2xx responses, surfaces them via an `aria-live` toast and
  throws (so callers skip their re-render) instead of breaking silently.
- [x] **Empty-library onboarding.** When the library is genuinely empty (no
  photos and no active filters) a first-run panel shows the
  `photo-atlas index` / `cluster` / `serve` commands; a filtered no-match still
  shows the plain "No photos match" message.
- [x] **Accessibility.** Lightbox is a focus-trapped `role="dialog"` that
  restores focus to the opening card on close; arrow keys no longer hijack
  typing in face inputs. Cards are keyboard-operable (`role=button`, Enter/Space),
  chips expose `aria-pressed`, pills have `aria-label`s, and a visible
  `:focus-visible` outline was added.

### Explicitly deferred (browser-only target)
- [ ] **Responsive / mobile layout.** `.layout` is a fixed `250px 1fr` grid with
  a sticky full-height sidebar; on small screens it needs a collapsible drawer.
  Skipped for now per usage (desktop browser only).
